### This is a simple bot on Aiogram for fun and a little programming practice. üëæ

You can play with the Bot, which has 4 difficulty levels: from easy to impossible. All results are stored in the `sqlite3` database. The bot can also be added to a group, where it organizes game battles between willing participants.

I can assume that this small project has its flaws and illogical lines of code that could be reduced and optimized. I would be very happy to see suggestions for improvement, if there are any.

## Using:   
Install the required libraries   
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After that you need to create a database by running the `create_db.py` file. Then write your bot token in `.env`. Finally you can run the `main.py` file and play at your pleasure)
